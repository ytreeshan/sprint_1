        <ul>
            <li>LabX was founded in 3022 by Dr. Time Turner, who accidentally discovered time travel during a failed coffee experiment.</li>
            <li>The LabX office is powered entirely by solar panels—and an occasional boost from hamsters on treadmills!</li>
            <li>LabX’s first product, the "Quantum Mug," can keep your coffee hot for up to 1,000 years.</li>
            <li>Every employee at LabX gets their own robot assistant, with names ranging from "BananaBot" to "MangoMax."</li>
            <li>LabX once created a miniature black hole in the lab, but don’t worry—it was only 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li>LabX has a policy where every meeting must include at least one bad science joke. The current record is 10 jokes in one meeting!</li>
            <li>LabX’s teleportation research has been successful—so far, it only works on sandwiches, though.</li>
            <li>Our team of scientists are working on a project to teach plants how to send emails. Progress is slow, but the plants are learning.</li>
            <li>LabX offices are located on Earth and Mars. The commute to Mars is surprisingly short if you take the morning rocket!</li>
            <li>LabX's official mascot is a hamster named Helix, who runs the company’s internal power grid.</li>
        </ul>
